ObjectiveC-JOSE
===============

Library for creating JSON Web Tokens (JWT), JSON Web Signature and JSON Web Encryption (JWE)

## Why?

I couldnâ€™t find any objective-c implementations of the JOSE draft standards. This way annoying so I decided to quickly create a library to handle all the logic for me.

I intend to use this together with Socket.io (and the handily objc-socket.io library) to use JWT for authentication.

## Currently Implemented

* Create a JWS (signed but unencrypted)
* Supports all public header fields in standard

## Usage 

Not ready for use yet, it does the basic job of creating and sig
